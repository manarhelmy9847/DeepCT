# üß† CT Scan Diagnosis Using Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning to analyze CT scan images for medical diagnosis. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect abnormalities such as tumors, infections, or COVID-related lung conditions in chest CT scans.

## üß¨ Overview
CT scans provide detailed images of internal body structures. This project aims to automate the diagnostic process using image classification models trained on medical imaging datasets, enhancing early detection and reducing workload on radiologists.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Preprocessing of CT scan images (resize, normalize, augmentation)
- Deep learning model (CNN-based classifier)
- Binary or multi-class classification (e.g., normal vs. abnormal)
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix)
- Optional deployment as a web-based diagnostic assistant
